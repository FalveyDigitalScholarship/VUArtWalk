The Awakening,mediathumbnail/Dugan-Awakening-tn.jpg,media/DuganAwakening.jpg,Villanova University / Molly Glynn,,"Villanova University's campus is home to Jay Dugan's striking sculpture, ""Awakening,"" affectionately dubbed the ""Oreo"" due to its resemblance to the popular cookie. Located in front of Dougherty Hall, the sculpture features three white travertine pylons from Italy and a twelve-foot-high black marble disk with two circular openings, sourced from North Africa. Weighing a massive 28 tons, ""Awakening"" represents the transformative journey of learning. Dugan crafted this abstract piece over 500 hours in Italy, intending to symbolize the intellectual and personal growth experienced by students at Villanova. The geometric shapes embody the awakening to limitless knowledge and new dimensions of life.

 ""The Triumph of David,"" a 20-ft wide by 12-ft high painting, arrived at Villanova University in 1956 from a donation by Princess Eugenia Ruspoli.

Stained Glass Windows,mediathumbnail/Cannuli-StainedGlass-tn.jpg,media/Cannuli-StainedGlass.jpg,Villanova University / Paul Crane,,"The stained glass windows of Corr Hall Chapel tell the story of a century-long project of Villanova. The Augustinian seminary, Corr Hall, was built in 1914 with 10 arching windows for the place of stained-glass depictions of figures significant to the university. Constrained by the impacts of the world wars and the Great Depression, only two windows were originally completed, depicting St. Augustine, St. Monica, the Virgin Mary, and St. Joseph. The other eight windows remained frosted until 2006, when the Rev. Richard Cannuli, OSA, MFA, ’73 CLAS designed three new windows to commemorate the 15 Villanovans who died on September 11, 2001.

Gregor Johann Mendel,mediathumbnail/GregorMendel-tn.jpg,media/GregorMendel.jpg,Villanova University / Paul Crane,,"In 1998, Villanova University commissioned Philadelphia artist James Peniston to create the Gregor Johann Mendel Sculpture that now graces the front of the Mendel Science Center. This modern work draws inspiration from the iconic Mendel monument in Brno, Czech Republic. Commissioned by the Brno Natural Science Society in 1906, the original sculpture was crafted by Theodore Charlemont. It features Mendel clad in an Augustinian habit, with pea plants elegantly entwined behind him—a nod to his dual roles as a priest at the Monastery of St. Thomas in Brno and a pioneering geneticist who unlocked the secrets of heredity through his groundbreaking pea plant experiments. Since 1926, Villanova University has awarded the Mendel Medal to Nobel Laureates, outstanding medical researchers, pioneers in physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and noted scientist-theologians.
