It features Mendel clad in an Augustinian habit, with pea plants elegantly entwined behind him--a nod to his dual roles as a priest at the Monastery of St. Thomas in Brno and a pioneering geneticist who unlocked the secrets of heredity through his groundbreaking pea plant experiments. Since 1926, Villanova University has awarded the Mendel Medal to Nobel Laureates, outstanding medical researchers, pioneers in physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, and noted scientist-theologians.</p>",17,Sculpture,blue,Mendel Science Center,40.038056,-75.343387,,,,,0.1,geojson/mendelcenter.geojson,"color: #000000; weight:3; fillColor:rgba(0,0,0,0)"
